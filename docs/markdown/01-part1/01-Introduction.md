# Quarkus Features - Container First

- Optimized for low memory usage
- Fast startup times
- Build Time processing
- Reduction in Reflection Usage

Notes:

Do at build-time what is usually done at runtime
Avoid reflection and dynamic proxies
ArC determines the injection graph at build time
Native image preboot : the native executable has already run most of the startup code, 
the result is serialized into the executable
