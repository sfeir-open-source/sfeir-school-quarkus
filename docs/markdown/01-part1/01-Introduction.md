# Why Quarkus ? 

- Java 25+ years
- Applications no longer runs on big machines
- Density is the new optimization
- **Goal** : Make Java the leading platform for cloud applications

Notes:<br>
nathan
Do at build-time what is usually done at runtime
Avoid reflection and dynamic proxies
ArC determines the injection graph at build time
Native image preboot : the native executable has already run most of the startup code, 
the result is serialized into the executable
