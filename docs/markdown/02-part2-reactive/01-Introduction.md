# Why do you use it ?

* Quarkus recommend to use it to manage handle asynchronous data streams and events
  * for example : a lot of requests in same time

* Asynchronous Component : all the operation are non-blocking (database driver too)
  * maximize processing capacity

* Quarkus Reactive is a extension => use it with other extension

* Reactives Streams : an asynchronous stream processing API. 
  * This API allows efficient management of asynchronous data streams and events.

* Vert.x optimize the I/O
